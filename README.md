# Simple Website Template [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/artemtam/helptofree.org.svg?token=ckp3nHysZza2y7rGcHP3&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/artemtam/helptofree.org)

Modern static website or landing page template, which provides ready to use configuration supporting mification, transpiling, SASS/SCSS and other essential features that makes your project perfect.

### Motivation

I have to make simple static websites (such as [helptofree.org](https://helptofree.org)) quite often. I love making things perfect, therefore every time I set up Webpack to compress the styles, minify HTML and so on.  
 
In order to make the process way faster, I decided to create this template with some basic configurations for building simple static websites and landing pages.

### Features

- [x] Ready to use Webpack configuration
- [x] SCSS/SASS support
- [x] Autoprefixing and minifying CSS
- [x] Uglifying and transpiling JavaScript
- [x] Minifying HTML
- [x] Automatic deployment to Github Pages with Travis CI
- [x] Stylelint to write consistent styles
- [x] ESLint with Airbnb code style rules 
- [ ] Minifying SVGs with SVGO

### Usage

Use this repository as a template for creating your own project. There is a "Use this template" button on the top right.
Install dependencies with `npm i`, start a development server executing `npm start` and build for the production running `npm run build`.
